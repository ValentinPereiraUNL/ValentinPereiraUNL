Hi there! I'm Valentin Pereira,I'm 23 years old and I'm an informatic engenieree student in UNL (Universidad del Litoral, ARG).
I'm on my third year right now and I'm starting to learn the basics of programming in my classes, but open to learn outside the university.
I'm pretty much new on this world, so I'm gonna try to expose what I do in class and outside here.
Thank you very much for reading this and hope to bring some good material to this portfolio.
